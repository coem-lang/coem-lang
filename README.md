# jcoem

This is the Java implementation of my Coem language. This was built by following the first half of Robert Nystrom's super accessible [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and customising it according to my intentions for the language.

**NOTE: this was great for following along in the book, but I'm not actively developing the language in Java at the moment. I'm keeping it open in case I need it, but will probably archive it soon. Head over to [jscoem](https://github.com/coem-lang/jscoem) instead!**

## Setup

If you have a setup for building Java applications, feel free to use that!

If you're new to Java build tools like I was, I found that the [Java build tools in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build) are really easy to use. It scans for the `pom.xml` file in the repository and uses the information in that file to build the application. After installing these tools, you can run the program by clicking the "Run" button that appears above the `main()` function in `Coem.java`, or by clicking the run button at the top right of the window when you open `Coem.java`.

## Learn

To learn more on what each file does and how the interpreter works, check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/coem-lang/jcoem/wiki/How-the-interpreter-works).
